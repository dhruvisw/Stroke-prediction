# Stroke-prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke in patients based on various clinical and demographic features. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk individuals and improving early intervention strategies.

üîç Key Learning Objectives
- Data Exploration:
Analyze and visualize the dataset to identify the most important patient and clinical characteristics associated with stroke risk.

- Model Development:
Build and validate a robust stroke prediction model using machine learning techniques in R, ensuring strong performance and generalizability.

- Model Deployment:
Deploy the predictive model in a user-friendly format to support clinical decision-making and enhance patient care within healthcare organizations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- R Programming
- tidyverse, caret, randomForest, and more 

üìÅ Dataset
Publicly available stroke dataset including features like age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, etc.

# Stroke-prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This data set is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

üîç Key Learning Objectives
- Data Exploration:
Analyze and visualize the dataset to identify the most important patient and clinical characteristics associated with stroke risk.

- Data Visualization
Conduct thorough EDA to understand patterns and trends in the dataset. Key visualizations include:
Gender v/s Stroke
Residence Type v/s Stroke
Average glucose level v/s Stroke and more

- Model Development:
Build and validate a robust stroke prediction model using machine learning techniques in R, ensuring strong performance and generalizability.

- Model Deployment:
Deploy the predictive model in a user-friendly format to support clinical decision-making and enhance patient care within healthcare organizations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- R Programming
- tidyverse, caret, randomForest, and more 

üìÅ Dataset
Publicly available stroke dataset including features like age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, etc.
